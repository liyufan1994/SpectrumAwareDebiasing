# Data Sharing Plans

We intend to share implementation code and data used for numerical experiments for the PNAS submission. The implementation code and instructions for running the code for reproduction is enclosed in a Jupyter Notebook code.ipynb. 

The data we used in this study to demonstrate our methodology are all in the public domain, extracted from (i) UCI Machine Learning Repository, (ii) OpenML and (iii) Scikit-Learn's real data repository. We cite the studies that originally published these data in Section 3.C and provide more information in Section 9.A of the Supplementary Information Appendix. 

We additionally include the data we used in a zip file (data.zip).
